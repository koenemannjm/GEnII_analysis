This repository is a catalog of the scripts used to analyze the GEnII data 
from the Jefferson Lab Halla A experiment. 

Something that will be very obvious is that in the scripts directory
all of the scripts reference a mystery "data" directory that is not
included in this repository. The simple reason is that I'm cloning over 
30Gb of data to GitHub even if they allowed it. The layout of the scripts
files will tell you everything you need to know about how I structured my
data directories to be able to use these exact scripts on that data, if
you have access to the data...

More details to come about what the structure of the directories and the 
scripts themselves.
